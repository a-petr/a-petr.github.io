<h1>Math 2603 (Introduction to Discrete Mathematics), Fall 2021</h1>

<h2>Complementary notes</h2>

<p>These notes are made in Jupyter notebook to complement the slides. 
In the links below they are run on Binder via nbinteract. You may need to press `Show Widgets` at the top of the page to show interactive widgets. You may also need to wait for a few secs for it to launch.  The Jupyer notebooks are hosted on Github at the  <a href="https://github.com/a-petr/math2603fall2021" > following repo</a>.  If you want to run locally you can download the notebooks from Github. </p>


<p>You can also go to binder by clicking the link below. There you will be able to modify, play with, and save the code (maybe a better option if there are numerical examples in the lecture note). </p>
