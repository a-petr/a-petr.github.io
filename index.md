<p>I am a Hale Visiting Assistant Professor in the School of Mathematics at Georgia Institute of Technology. 
<!-- Before joining Georgia Tech, I was a member of the Computational and Applied Mathematics Group at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory as a postdoctoral researcher. 
 --></p>



<p>I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Mathematics from Vanderbilt University. My research interests are at the intersection of applied harmonic analysis and machine learning.  I study approximation and representation capabilities of artificial neural networks, and problems related to the recovery of systems of signals under sparsity or structural assumptions.
