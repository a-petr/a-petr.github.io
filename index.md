<p>I am Hale Visiting Assistant Professor (postdoc) in the Department of Mathematics at Georgia Institute of Technology. </p>


<p>Previously I was a member of the Computational and Applied Mathematics Group at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory as a postdoctoral researcher since August 2017.  Before joining ORNL, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Mathematics from Vanderbilt University. My research interests are at the intersection of applied harmonic analysis and machine learning.  I study approximation and representation capabilities of artificial neural networks, and problems related to the recovery of systems of signals under sparsity or structural assumptions.
